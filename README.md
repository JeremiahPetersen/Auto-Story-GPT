# Auto-Story-GPT
This code is a Flask web app that utilizes GPT-3.5 to generate AI responses for storytelling. It allows users to input a story idea and a story, and select a character or narrator. The application generates responses based on the provided inputs. Users can also adjust for continuity or logic issues in a story, and rewrite the story to improve it.
# How to Use
You can adjust the character names / personalities in the html and json files to your specifications.  I have provided a Futurama story generator as an example use case.
You start by creating a story idea and choose a character, narrator, or scene description, and click generate.  The story will append to the bottom of the page.  You can edit the created story at any time.
